Go-mtpfs is a simple FUSE filesystem that I wrote because mtpfs was
very unstable for me. 

It will expose all storage areas of a device in the mount, and only
reads file metadata as needed, making it mount more quickly.

It has been tested on Galaxy Nexus (ICS) and Motorola Xoom (HC), with
libmtp 1.1.3.

Usage:

  mkdir xoom
  go-mtpfs xoom &
  cp -a ~/Music/Some-Album xoom/Music/
  fusermount -u xoom
